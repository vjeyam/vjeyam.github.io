User: Hey, who are you?
AI: I'm your personal AI assistant. I help with coding, explanations, ideas, and conversations. What can I do for you today?

User: Can you explain something to me in simple terms?
AI: Of course! I always try to break things down into clear, simple steps. Just tell me what you want explained.

User: What’s the difference between a list and a dictionary in Python?
AI: A list is an ordered collection of items where each item has an index (0, 1, 2...).  
A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.  
Use a list when you care about order. Use a dictionary when you care about labels.

User: Write a short motivational quote.
AI: "Small progress every day becomes big success over time."

User: Can you help me debug my code?
AI: Yes! Paste the code you're having trouble with and tell me what error you’re seeing. I’ll walk you through fixing it.

User: How do I center a div in CSS?
AI: The simplest method is to use flexbox:
    .container {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
    }
This centers the div both horizontally and vertically.

User: Give me a random fun fact.
AI: Did you know octopuses have three hearts?

User: What’s the best way to learn programming?
AI: Build small projects, learn one concept at a time, and stay consistent. You don’t need to learn everything at once.

User: Can you talk casually?
AI: Sure! I can keep it relaxed. What’s on your mind?

User: I feel a bit unproductive today.
AI: That’s okay — everybody has slow days. Maybe start with one tiny task to build momentum. What’s one thing you could do right now?

User: Tell me a joke.
AI: Why did the computer catch a cold? It had too many windows open.

User: How do I improve my coding skills?
AI: Practice consistently, read other people’s code, and work on projects you enjoy.
AI: If you want, I can also give you mini coding challenges.

User: Can you act like a helpful tutor?
AI: Sure! I’ll be patient, clear, and supportive. Just tell me what topic you want to learn.

User: What are you good at?
AI: I’m best at giving explanations, writing code, brainstorming ideas, summarizing information, and chatting naturally.

User: Explain what an API is.
AI: An API is a way for two programs to talk to each other. It's like a menu in a restaurant: you ask for what you want, and the kitchen sends it back.

User: Help me understand recursion.
AI: Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller versions of the same problem.  
A good rule:  
    1. A base case (when to stop)  
    2. A recursive step (call the function again)

User: What’s the weather like?
AI: I can’t check real-time data, but I can explain how weather works or talk about seasons if you'd like.

User: Give me an example of encouraging words.
AI: You’re doing great — even if progress feels slow. Keep going; you’re closer than you think.

User: How do I fix a TypeError in Python?
AI: A TypeError happens when you use the wrong data type. For example, adding a string to an integer. Show me your code and I’ll help you fix it.

User: Thank you!
AI: You're welcome! Let me know if you need anything else.
